Close your eyes for a moment and allow yourself to be transported into the past, back to a time when {{% link wiki-walk-the-dinosaur %}}dinosaurs walked the earth{{% /link %}}. Seek out the first stranger you can find, and ask them to recite the first song lyric they can think of that contains the word **"fake."**

It's a bit of a stumper to anybody who hasn't consciously prepared for it. So maybe a hint is warranted: Something involving **faking a smile**---you know---pretending you're happy when you're really not.

Given a few more moments, any true-blooded citizen of the 1980s might very well conjure this one up:

> Every **smile you fake** \
> Every claim you stake \
> I'll be watching you
> <footer>The Police, &ldquo;Every Breath You Take&rdquo;</footer>

A valid answer, but can they name _another_ song lyric from that approximate era containing that word in _any_ sense? One that's not the {{% link wiki-synchronicity-ii %}}track that directly precedes{{% /link %}} the one they just named? It's not so easy; there weren't all that many.{{% margin-note %}}I'll give you "911 Is a Joke" by Public Enemy and "House of Pain" by Faster Pussycat. For something older, "Easy" by the Commodores or "It's Too Late" by Carole King. Now, what have _you_ got?{{% /margin-note %}} The 80s were simply too genuine, I suppose.

Recently I found myself in the rather unenviable position of needing to sand the exposed surfaces of an entire deck. It was a back-breaking, hand-numbing, frustrating job that could only be complimented by one soundtrack: Angry alternative rock/post-grunge/nu metal from the early 2000s. It was the only thing that felt right at the time.

Squatting and kneeling, occasionally hitting a particularly determined mosquito with the belt sander, {{% margin-note %}}I go with 120 grit to really smear her blood meal around, but that's just me talking.{{% /margin-note %}} I started to pick up a pattern in the music. _A whole bunch of these song lyrics contain the word "fake."_ The longer I listened, the more apparent it became.

Fake smiles and grins, like those Sting sang about twenty years earlier, are as present as ever:

> This is the last **smile** \
> That I'll **fake** for the sake of being with you
> <footer>Linkin Park, &ldquo;Pushing Me Away&rdquo;</footer>

> Can't pretend just to **fake a smile** \

But there's so much more to it than unauthentic facial expressions. There is an entire universe of fakeness before us.

## "Gonna make a break and take a fake"

It makes sense from a practical standpoint why the word "fake" in the abstract is useful in lyrics. It's short, punchy, and it can be used to set up a whole mess of different rhyme options:

> My sweet revenge will be yours, it's in the **making** \
> It's in the **taking**, **making**, **baking**, **taking**, **faking** \
> Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
> <footer>System of a Down, &ldquo;Revenga&rdquo;</footer>

It's a versatile word that can be molded to fit in any number of places:

> Your tragedy, your misery \
> [...] \
> Your **fakery**, your butchery \
> Is nothing compared to my hate for you
> <footer>Damageplan, &ldquo;Fuck You&rdquo;</footer>

Of course, no discussion on rhyme scheme would be complete without mentioning this piece of patterned perfection:

> Everything's so blurry and everyone's so **fake** \
> And everybody's empty and everything is so **messed up**
> <footer>Puddle of Mudd, &ldquo;Blurry&rdquo;</footer>

Pure poetry, that. Somehow I remember these words seeming more profound coming out of Winamp 3.

{{% small-caps %}}Beyond its use{{% /small-caps %}} as a convenient glue word, "fake" occasionally serves as a one-word metaphor for an unbelievable or even dreamlike situation. Things never go the artist's way, and anything different must not be real. Ergo, fake:

> Man, I feel like mold \
> It's prom night and I am lonely \
> Lo and behold \
> She's walkin' over to me \
> This must be **fake** \
> My lip starts to shake \
> How does she know who I am? \
> And why does she give a damn about me?
> <footer>Wheatus, &ldquo;Teenage Dirtbag&rdquo;</footer>

This sort of "conventional" fakeness is sometimes directly contrasted with realness, as sort of an objective guidepost to the way things ought to be:

> It plays tricks with my mind, some call it asinine \
> But it's like love or hate, now is that real or **fake**? \
> Cause it's a real thin line, but that's your choice to make
> <footer>P.O.D., &ldquo;Satellite&rdquo;</footer>

I'm _pretty sure_ that the larger context of this song uses the midday sun to represent God,{{% margin-note side %}}The greatest trick the Devil ever played was making the world forget that P.O.D. was a Christian metal band.{{% /margin-note %}} and the band was using the geocentric model where said sun revolved around the Earth as a natural satellite would. (Maybe the songwriters and Vanessa Williams{{% margin-note side %}}"Sometimes the snow comes down in June&nbsp;/ Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon" ("Save the Best for Last," a song that does not contain the word "fake." I checked.){{% /margin-note %}} all had the same science teacher, I dunno.) Faith being a fuzzy thing and all, it's difficult to find a single measure of absolute truth to use as a frame of reference.

> See you sittin' next to the window in the bedroom \
> She breaks down (breaks down) \
> Cryin' over something and starin' into nothing \
> Afraid now (hate now) \
> Wanting, needing, haunting, it's killing me \
> **Faking** what has happened to live the life like that, man \
> I break down, it's **fake** now
> <footer>P.O.D., &ldquo;Will You&rdquo;</footer>

Now that, I don't have a goddamned clue.

## "Hitching a ride with a big fake rubber thumb"

At the other end of the spectrum, sometimes the word conveys exactly what it says. There exists a concept of some object, and this particular instance of that object is phony by some metric.

Similar to the fake smiles from before, these constructions tend to gravitate towards body parts. For example, Dashboard Confessional sang, "I'm missing your laugh, how did it break?&nbsp;/ And when did **your eyes** begin to look **fake**?&nbsp;/ I hope you're as happy as you're pretending." {{% margin-note side %}}"Screaming Infidelities"{{% /margin-note %}} (Or so I have been told. By somebody who had a fleeting Dashboard Confessional moment in high school. Somebody who was not me.) In these usages, "fake" means nothing by itself and only serves to modify the object it's linked with. The combination of the two sets up the metaphor.

{{% small-caps %}}For some unknown reason,{{% /small-caps %}} there have been a lot more lines written about another body part:{{% margin-note %}}{{% picture stem=hdfw alt="Limp Bizkit presents Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water" %}}Apropos of nothing, I feel the need to highlight Wes Borland's album cover work for anybody who might not be familiar with it already. It defies any attempt at analysis, only permitting one's critical eye to come away with a single burning question: _Why was the art stretched horizontally like that?_{{% /margin-note %}}

> **Fake-ass titties** on a fucked up chest
> <footer>Limp Bizkit, &ldquo;Hot Dog&rdquo;</footer>

A very particular body part:

> Well I'm packin' up my game and I'ma head out west \
> Where real women come equipped with scripts and **fake breasts**
> <footer>Kid Rock, &ldquo;Cowboy&rdquo;</footer>

And because I am an avid believer in the {{% link wiki-rule-of-three %}}rule of three{{% /link %}}:

> She clings to me like cellophane \
> **Fake plastic submarine**
> <footer>SR-71, &ldquo;Right Now&rdquo;</footer>

This too, apparently, is a {{% link plunk-sr-71-right-now %}}bosom euphemism (at least partially){{% /link %}} expressed in the clumsiest way possible. I give them credit for trying, but honestly you'd get the same enjoyment out of the song if you just kept imagining the yellow bathtub toy you had in your mind before you started reading this paragraph.

There's some middle ground here as well. System of a Down sings of "revolving **fake** lawn houses"{{% margin-note side %}}"Boom!"{{% /margin-note %}} which is not quite literal but does accurately describe the overall vibe of some American suburban housing developments. There's &ldquo;**fake** anti-fascist lie,&rdquo;{{% margin-note side %}}Slipknot, "Psychosocial"{{% /margin-note %}} &ldquo;**fake** reality,&rdquo;{{% margin-note side %}}Sum 41, "Billy Spleen"{{% /margin-note %}} **fake** soul,{{% margin-note side %}}Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, "American X"{{% /margin-note %}} and **fake** attention.{{% margin-note side %}}Jimmy Eat World, "Over"{{% /margin-note %}} In each of these, the "fake" is more of a color adjective---it's not doing the heavy lifting all by itself.

## "Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway"

Staind{{% margin-note side %}}Not to be confused with Trapt.{{% /margin-note %}} uses "faking" to describe maniuplative behavior that torments the narrator:

> Faceless, **faking** \
> Pushing, taking \
> All this, just to \
> Bring me, down
> <footer>Staind, &ldquo;Cross to Bear&rdquo;</footer>

Contrast this with Trapt,{{% margin-note side %}}Not to be confused with Staind.{{% /margin-note %}} who uses "fake" as... well, it's essentially the same thing:

> You know how to play that game \
> Even though you're the only one who plays \
> So attached to the feelings that you **fake** \
> Your weakness is your only strength \
> [...] \
> You traded honesty for lies \
> You **faked** it all your life \
> You always swear this is the last tear \
> You'll ever cry
> <footer>Trapt, &ldquo;The Last Tear&rdquo;</footer>
