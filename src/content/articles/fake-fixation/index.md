{{% /epigraph %}}

Close your eyes for a moment and allow yourself to be transported into the past, back to a time when {{% link wiki-walk-the-dinosaur %}}dinosaurs walked the earth{{% /link %}}. Seek out the first stranger you can find, and ask them to recite the first song lyric they can think of that contains the word **"fake."**

It's a bit of a stumper to anybody who hasn't consciously prepared for it. So maybe a hint is warranted: Something involving **faking a smile**---you know---pretending you're happy when you're really not.

Given a few more moments, any true-blooded citizen of the 1980s might very well conjure this one up:

> Every **smile you fake** \
> Every claim you stake \
> I'll be watching you
> <footer>The Police, &ldquo;Every Breath You Take&rdquo;</footer>

A valid answer, but can they name _another_ song lyric from that era containing that word in _any_ sense? One that's not the {{% link wiki-synchronicity-ii %}}track that directly precedes{{% /link %}} the one they just named? It's not so easy; there weren't all that many.{{% margin-note %}}I'll give you "911 Is a Joke" by Public Enemy and "House of Pain" by Faster Pussycat. What have _you_ got?{{% /margin-note %}} The 80s were simply too genuine, I suppose.

## I'll take Napster Downloads for $200, Alex.

Recently I found myself in the rather unenviable position of needing to sand the exposed surfaces of an entire deck. It was a back-breaking, hand-numbing, frustrating job that could only be complimented by one soundtrack: Angry alternative rock/post-grunge/nu metal from the early 2000s. It was the only thing that felt right at the time.

Squatting and kneeling, occasionally hitting a particularly determined mosquito with the belt sander, {{% margin-note %}}I go with 120 grit to really smear her blood meal around, but that's just me talking.{{% /margin-note %}} I started to pick up a pattern in the music. _A whole bunch of these song lyrics contain the word "fake."_ The longer I listened, the more apparent it became.

Fake smiles and grins, like those Sting sang about twenty years earlier, are as present as ever:

> This is the last **smile** \
> That I'll **fake** for the sake of being with you
> <footer>Linkin Park, &ldquo;Pushing Me Away&rdquo;</footer>

From Simple Plan{{% margin-note side %}}"Welcome to My Life"{{% /margin-note %}} to Crossfade,{{% margin-note side %}}"Someday"{{% /margin-note %}} Disturbed{{% margin-note side %}}"Asylum"{{% /margin-note %}} to Blink-182,{{% margin-note side %}}"Story of a Lonely Guy"{{% /margin-note %}} seems like nobody in any of these songs was really happy.

> Can't pretend just to **fake a smile** \
> 'Cause you know I feel every ounce of \
> Pain [...]
> <footer>Shinedown, &ldquo;Trade Yourself In&rdquo;</footer>

And also Everlast,{{% margin-note side %}}"Stay"{{% /margin-note %}} and Lostprophets,{{% margin-note side %}}"Can't Stop, Gotta Date with Hate"{{% /margin-note %}} and Guster,{{% margin-note side %}}"Mona Lisa"{{% /margin-note %}} and...

> From now on I'm going to start holding my breath \
> When you come around and you flex that **fake grin** \
> 'Cause something inside me has said more than twice \
> That breathing less air beats breathing you in
> <footer>Incubus, &ldquo;Blood on the Ground&rdquo;</footer>

And we haven't even explored the likes of Taylor Swift,{{% margin-note side %}}"Cold As You"; "Teardrops On My Guitar"{{% /margin-note %}} Matchbox Twenty,{{% margin-note side %}}"Bed of Lies"{{% /margin-note %}} Alkaline Trio,{{% margin-note side %}}"Another Innocent Girl"{{% /margin-note %}} you know, the sorts of songs that make you fumble around for the ":fast_forward:" button due to how insufficiently angry they are for the task at hand.

But there's so much more to it than unauthentic facial expressions. There is an entire universe of fakeness before us.

## "Gonna make a break and take a fake"

It makes sense from a practical standpoint why the word "fake" in the abstract is useful in lyrics. It's short, punchy, and it can be used to set up a whole mess of different rhyme options:

> My sweet revenge will be yours, it's in the **making** \
> It's in the **taking**, **making**, **baking**, **taking**, **faking** \
> Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
> <footer>System of a Down, &ldquo;Revenga"</footer>

It's a versatile word that can be molded to fit in any number of places:

> Your tragedy, your misery \
> But most of all fuck you \
> [...] \
> Your **fakery**, your butchery \
> Is nothing compared to my hate for you
> <footer>Damageplan, &ldquo;Fuck You&rdquo;</footer>

Of course, no discussion on rhyme scheme would be complete without mentioning this piece of patterned perfection:

> Everything's so blurry and everyone's so **fake** \
> And everybody's empty and everything is so **messed up**
> <footer>Puddle of Mudd, &ldquo;Blurry&rdquo;</footer>

Pure poetry, that. Somehow I remember these words seeming more profound coming out of Winamp 3.

That's 13 tracks spanning 18 years. The distribution is pretty even; they're as down with the fakeness today as they've always been.
