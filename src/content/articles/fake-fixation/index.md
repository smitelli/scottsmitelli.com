Close your eyes for a moment and allow yourself to be transported into the past, back to a time when {{% link wiki-walk-the-dinosaur %}}dinosaurs walked the earth{{% /link %}}. Seek out the first stranger you can find, and ask them to recite the first song lyric they can think of that contains the word **"fake."**

It's a bit of a stumper to anybody who hasn't consciously prepared for it. So maybe a hint is warranted: Something involving **faking a smile**---you know---pretending you're happy when you're really not.

Given a few more moments, any true-blooded citizen of the 1980s might very well conjure this one up:

> Every **smile you fake** \
> Every claim you stake \
> I'll be watching you
> <footer>The Police, &ldquo;Every Breath You Take&rdquo;</footer>

A valid answer, but can they name _another_ song lyric from that approximate era containing that word in _any_ sense? {{% margin-note %}}I'll give you "911 Is a Joke" by Public Enemy and "House of Pain" by Faster Pussycat. For something older, "Easy" by the Commodores or "It's Too Late" by Carole King. Now, what have _you_ got?{{% /margin-note %}} One that's not the {{% link wiki-synchronicity-ii %}}track that directly precedes{{% /link %}} the one they just named? It's not so easy; there weren't all that many. The 80s were simply too genuine, I suppose.

## I'll take Napster Downloads for $200, Alex.

Recently I found myself in the rather unenviable position of needing to sand the exposed surfaces of an entire deck. It was a back-breaking, hand-numbing, frustrating job that could only be complimented by one soundtrack: Angry alternative rock/post-grunge/nu metal from the early 2000s. It was the only thing that felt right at the time.

Squatting and kneeling, occasionally hitting a particularly determined mosquito with the belt sander, {{% margin-note %}}I go with 120 grit to really smear her blood meal around, but that's just me talking.{{% /margin-note %}} I started to pick up a pattern in the music. _A whole bunch of these song lyrics contain the word "fake."_ The longer I listened, the more apparent it became.

Fake smiles and grins, like those Sting sang about twenty years earlier, are as present as ever:

> This is the last **smile** \
> That I'll **fake** for the sake of being with you
> <footer>Linkin Park, &ldquo;Pushing Me Away&rdquo;</footer>

Every single one of these songs has some kind of unauthentic facial expression in the lyrics.

But we've barely scratched the surface. There is an entire universe of fakeness before us.

## "Gonna make a break and take a fake"

It makes sense from a practical standpoint why the word "fake" in the abstract is useful in lyrics. {{% margin-note %}}Just look at the alternatives: _feign_, _scam_, _pretend_, _bogus_, _phony_, _insincere_, _disingenuous_. They all sound... goofy.{{% /margin-note %}} It's short, punchy, and it can be used to set up a whole mess of different rhyme options:

> My sweet revenge will be yours, it's in the **making** \
> It's in the **taking**, **making**, **baking**, **taking**, **faking** \
> Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
> <footer>System of a Down, &ldquo;Revenga&rdquo;</footer>

It's a versatile word that can be molded to fit in any number of places:

> Your tragedy, your misery \
> [...] \
> Your **fakery**, your butchery \
> Is nothing compared to my hate for you
> <footer>Damageplan, &ldquo;Fuck You&rdquo;</footer>

Of course, no discussion on rhyme scheme would be complete without mentioning this piece of patterned perfection:{{% margin-note %}}The choruses and bridge in this one are pretty all-over-the-place in terms of rhyme, but this is the only instance of a verse breaking the _AABB_ pattern. Maybe it was an intentional literary device, where "everything"---including this line---was "messed up."{{% /margin-note %}}

> Everything's so blurry and everyone's so **fake** \
> And everybody's empty and everything is so **messed up**
> <footer>Puddle of Mudd, &ldquo;Blurry&rdquo;</footer>

Pure poetry, that. Somehow I remember these words seeming more profound coming out of Winamp 3.

{{% small-caps %}}Beyond its use{{% /small-caps %}} as a convenient glue word, "fake" occasionally serves as a one-word metaphor for an unbelievable or even dreamlike situation. Things never go the artist's way, and anything different must not be real. Ergo, fake:

> Man, I feel like mold \
> It's prom night and I am lonely \
> Lo and behold \
> She's walkin' over to me \
> This must be **fake** \
> My lip starts to shake \
> How does she know who I am? \
> And why does she give a damn about me?
> <footer>Wheatus, &ldquo;Teenage Dirtbag&rdquo;</footer>

This sort of "situational" fakeness is sometimes directly contrasted with realness:

> It plays tricks with my mind, some call it asinine \
> But it's like love or hate, now is that real or **fake**? \
> Cause it's a real thin line, but that's your choice to make
> <footer>P.O.D., &ldquo;Satellite&rdquo;</footer>

I'm _pretty sure_ that the larger context of this song uses the midday sun to represent God,{{% margin-note side %}}The greatest trick the Devil ever played was making the world forget that P.O.D. was a Christian metal band.{{% /margin-note %}} and the band was using the geocentric model where said sun revolved around the Earth as a natural satellite would. (Maybe the songwriters and Vanessa Williams{{% margin-note side %}}"Sometimes the snow comes down in June&nbsp;/ Sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon" ("Save the Best for Last," a song that does not contain the word "fake." I checked.){{% /margin-note %}} all had the same science teacher, I dunno.)

"Fake" in adjective form also appears frequently in metaphors. But it really shines in its verb and noun forms, as we'll see in a bit.

## "Hitching a ride with a big fake rubber thumb"

It's not uncommon to find lyrics containing a phrase like "fake [thing]," where the thing could either be a literal object or (more commonly) something to be taken in a metaphorical sense. In the earlier examples of "fake smile," the interpretation is that there is an insencere emotion present---_not_ that the subject of the song was wearing a literal smile-shaped wax novelty mouth.

These constructions tend to gravitate towards body parts. For example, Dashboard Confessional sang, "I'm missing your laugh, how did it break?&nbsp;/ And when did **your eyes** begin to look **fake**?&nbsp;/ I hope you're as happy as you're pretending." {{% margin-note side %}}"Screaming Infidelities"{{% /margin-note %}} (Or so I have been told. By somebody who had a fleeting Dashboard Confessional phase in high school. Somebody who was not me.) In these usages, "fake" means nothing by itself and only serves to modify the object it's linked with. The combination of the two sets up the metaphor.

_For some reason,_ there has been a lot more ink spent writing lyrics around another body part:{{% margin-note %}}{{% picture stem=hdfw alt="Limp Bizkit presents Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water" %}}Apropos of nothing, I feel the need to highlight Wes Borland's album cover work for anybody who might not be familiar with it already. It defies any attempt at analysis, only permitting one's critical eye to come away with a single burning question: _Why was the art stretched horizontally like that?_{{% /margin-note %}}

> **Fake-ass titties** on a fucked up chest
> <footer>Limp Bizkit, &ldquo;Hot Dog&rdquo;</footer>

A very particular body part:

> Well I'm packin' up my game and I'ma head out west \
> Where real women come equipped with scripts and **fake breasts**
> <footer>Kid Rock, &ldquo;Cowboy&rdquo;</footer>

And because I am an avid believer in the {{% link wiki-rule-of-three %}}rule of three{{% /link %}}:

> She clings to me like cellophane \
> **Fake plastic submarine**
> <footer>SR-71, &ldquo;Right Now&rdquo;</footer>

This too, apparently, is a {{% link plunk-sr-71-right-now %}}bosom euphemism (at least partially){{% /link %}} expressed in the clumsiest way possible. I give them credit for trying, but honestly you'd get the same enjoyment out of the song if you just kept imagining the yellow bathtub toy you had in your mind before you started reading this paragraph.

Anatomical abundance aside, it doesn't take much to find metaphors built around inanimate objects. System of a Down sings of "revolving **fake** lawn houses"{{% margin-note side %}}"Boom!"{{% /margin-note %}} to describe the overall vibe of some American suburban housing developments. There's &ldquo;**fake** anti-fascist lie,&rdquo;{{% margin-note side %}}Slipknot, "Psychosocial"{{% /margin-note %}} &ldquo;**fake** reality,&rdquo;{{% margin-note side %}}Sum 41, "Billy Spleen"{{% /margin-note %}} **fake** tears,{{% margin-note side %}}Red Hot Chili Peppers, "Storm in a Teacup"{{% /margin-note %}} **fake** soul,{{% margin-note side %}}Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, "American X"{{% /margin-note %}} and **fake** attention.{{% margin-note side %}}Jimmy Eat World, "Over"{{% /margin-note %}} In each of these, the "fake" is more of a color adjective---it's not doing the heavy lifting all by itself.

## "Our subject isn't cool, but he fakes it anyway"

In verb form, the word "fake" starts sending these songs down new avenues, most of which involve a sense of scheming or deception. Staind{{% margin-note side %}}Not to be confused with Trapt.{{% /margin-note %}} uses "faking" to describe maniuplative behavior committed by somebody---possibly a romantic partner, but definitely an enemy---that torments the narrator:

> Faceless, **faking** \
> Pushing, taking \
> All this, just to \
> Bring me, down
> <footer>Staind, &ldquo;Cross to Bear&rdquo;</footer>

Contrast this with Trapt,{{% margin-note side %}}Not to be confused with Staind.{{% /margin-note %}} who uses "fake" as... well, it's essentially the same thing:

> You know how to play that game \
> Even though you're the only one who plays \
> So attached to the feelings that you **fake** \
> Your weakness is your only strength \
> [...] \
> You traded honesty for lies \
> You **faked it** all your life \
> You always swear this is the last tear \
> You'll ever cry
> <footer>Trapt, &ldquo;The Last Tear&rdquo;</footer>

Sometimes the target of such criticism is oblivious to the fact that they're engaging in any sort of fakery in the first place:

> How can we **fake this** anymore? \
> To turn our backs away and choose to just ignore \
> Some say it's ignorance \
> It makes me feel some innocence
> <footer>Sum 41, &ldquo;No Reason&rdquo;</footer>

In this case, all of society is faking by failing to take charge of the world{{% margin-note side %}}Or at least the world as it existed halfway through the George W. Bush administration.{{% /margin-note %}} and make things better for everybody. This is _somewhat_ undercut by some of their lines from a different song released about two years earlier: "It's all just a waste of time in the end&nbsp;/ Don't care, so why should I even pretend?"{{% margin-note side %}}"Motivation," which _does_ contain the word "fake."{{% /margin-note %}}

Often a situation is encountered where one person confesses, accuses, or pleads another person to engage in an act of deceit:

> Hey, hey, now, can you **fake it**? \
> Can you make it look like we won?
> <footer>Foo Fighters, &ldquo;Stacked Actors&rdquo;</footer>

Though if I were to name one band that was the unduspited king of using "fake" in this sort of way, it would be Seether. Their usage is significant enough that they are going to get The Table&trade;:

{{% /fullwidth %}}

By my count, that's 68 utterances of some variant of "fake" on 13 tracks spanning 18 years. The distribution is pretty even; they're as down with the fakeness today as they've always been. In all of the research carried out in preparing this piece, I have not seen another 2000s-era artist that was anywhere near as attuned to fakeness as Seether.

Of all the forms of the word "fake," this verb form definitely has the widest range. It can be used to build yourself up,{{% margin-note side %}}Pantera, "Goddamn Electric"; Thrice, "Betrayal Is a Symptom"; The Offspring, "Come out Swinging"{{% /margin-note %}} tear yourself down,{{% margin-note side %}}Chevelle, "Don't Fake This"; Papa Roach, "The Enemy"; Feeder, "Shatter"{{% /margin-note %}} criticize a friend,{{% margin-note side %}}The Offspring, "(Can't Get My) Head Around You"; Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, "Lien on Your Dreams"{{% /margin-note %}} criticize yourself,{{% margin-note side %}}Stone Sour, "Socio"; Breaking Benjamin, "Phase"; Fuel, "Hemorrhage (In My Hands)"{{% /margin-note %}} criticize society,{{% margin-note side %}}Our Lady Peace, "Superman's Dead"; Lagwagon, "Automatic"; Thrice, "Motion Isn't Meaning"{{% /margin-note %}} or destroy a relationship.{{% margin-note side %}}SR-71, "Goodbye"; Motion City Soundtrack, "When You're Around"; Sum 41, "Crazy Amanda Bunkface"; The Offspring, "Vultures"; Atreyu, "Our Sick Story"; Puddle of Mudd, "Blood on the Table"{{% /margin-note %}}

Fundamentally each of these usages is based around some kind of lie. From living in a society of ignorant sheep, to suffering through a romantic relationship or parasitic sort of friendship, all the way down to an argument with your own (more than likely clinically depressed) self, the fakeness represents tension. Very few of these songs could be described as even remotely cheerful; it's more, "I'm screwed up, you're screwed up, everything's screwed up, tune 'em down to drop C&sharp;."

For fake-filled songs that have nothing to do with metal or metal-adjacent genres, I might recommend "I Wanna Have Your Babies" by Natasha Bedingfield, "6 in the Morning" by D12, "Hot Like Fire" by Jessica Simpson, or "No Diggity" by Blackstreet. Or "From Chaos" by 311, "I Know I Know I Know" by Tegan and Sara, "Crumble" by Dinosaur Jr., or "Womanizer" by Britney Spears. Every damn one of these has some kind of fake behavior.

(Or "Complicated" by Avril Lavigne, "Explode" by Nelly Furtado, "Drop It Like It's Hot" by Snoop Dogg, "But It's Better If You Do" by Panic! at the Disco, or...)

## "You're a phony, you know we figured you out, fake!"

The final layer of the part-of-speech cake is the nouns. In these usages, the subject is neither acting fake nor appearing fake---it _actually is_ a fake thing:{{% margin-note %}}Like pretty much every other occurrence, these things are only fake in the metaphorical sense. I'm sure somebody has written a song about schizophrenic delusions where their friends and family are replaced with {{% link wiki-simulacrum %}}simulacra{{% /link %}}, but that's not what most of these are.{{% /margin-note %}}

> Such a waste, what a shame \
> My whole life is a **fake**
> <footer>Crossfade, &ldquo;Dead Skin&rdquo;

Now, at this point, I'm going to piss off a bunch of English teachers by also lumping in usages that are actually adjectives, but behave more like nouns where they appear. See, you could say "Joe is a fake" like in the Crossfade lyric above, but you could also say "Joe is fake" to mean effectively the same thing:

> I could be **fake** \
> I could be stupid \
> You know I could be just like you
> <footer>Three Days Grace, &ldquo;Just Like You&rdquo;</footer>

In each of the preceding examples you could add or remove an article to convert "fake" between a noun or an adjective without substantially affecting the meaning of the lyrics; songwriting as a form of communication is simply not precise enough for the difference to matter in most cases. The more noticable effect is on the rhythmic flow of the line, which is most likely what dictated the word choice in the first place.

The noun form of "fake" fits a wide range of scenarios. Some use it in a cocky or self-aggrandizing way, proudly proclaiming that they are the best or most original at the kind of music they make, and the hell with all of the cheap imitators.{{% margin-note side %}}Kid Rock, "Forever"; Pantera, "We'll Grind That Axe for a Long Time"; Limp Bizkit, "Phenomenon"{{% /margin-note %}} Other grandiose usages suggest that a society of sheep who are all going to be saved (or conquered) by some kind of epic figure.{{% margin-note side %}}Rob Zombie, "Jesus Frankenstein"; Chevelle, "Bend the Bracket"{{% /margin-note %}} On the lighter side of the spectrum, some of these lyrics describe vacuous fame-seekers who will happily pretend to be something they're not for success, or to catch the romantic interests of a successful person.{{% margin-note side %}}Big D and the Kids Table, "LAX"; Good Charlotte, "I Just Wanna Live"; Marilyn Manson, "Ka-Boom Ka-Boom." (Preposterous fact: Those last two songs both independently mention the idea of wearing a "lawsuit" as clothing.){{% /margin-note %}}

On a more interpersonal level, groups of people can be described as "fake" if they are a real or perceived enemy, or some kind of backstabbing liar.{{% margin-note side %}}Korn, "Fear Is a Place to Live"; Hatebreed, "Straight To Your Face"; Crazy Town, "Skulls and Stars"{{% /margin-note %}} Less adversarial but still disingenuious people can also be fakes simply by hiding the truth from others, which can go both ways.{{% margin-note side %}}Breaking Benjamin, "I Will Not Bow"; Sum 41, "Over My Head (Better off Dead)"; Smile Empty Soul, "Who I Am" (Yeah, from the _Spider-Man 2_ soundtrack. Maybe "Superman (It's Not Easy)" by Five for Fighting had a scheduling conflict.){{% /margin-note %}}

And of course, all of this lying and faking inevitably leads to the breakdown of friendships and romantic relationships alike.{{% margin-note side %}}Papa Roach, "Burn"; Godsmack, "I Fucking Hate You"; Placebo, "Battle for the Sun"; Black Label Society, "Low Down"; Saving Abel, "Out of My Face"; Goldfinger, "Bro"{{% /margin-note %}} The beautiful thing about the word "fake" is that you can use it to describe the entire population of this planet, or you could use it in reference to yourself and yourself alone. It works equally well either way, and it tends to boil down to the same thing: "I am not like them, or they are not like me. Has anybody seen my DS-1 pedal?"

And if you thought I would end a section without a dense paragraph where I prattle off a dozen song names that didn't fit into the rest of the article: "You Get What You Give" by The New Radicals, "Cold Wind Blows" by Eminem, "I'm a Fake" by The Used,{{% margin-note side %}}I actually laughed out loud while listening to this one. Screamo is, uh, let's just say it is not to my liking.{{% /margin-note %}} "Fuck the World" by Insane Clown Posse,{{% margin-note side %}}This might be the original "I said 'fuck' a preposterous and specific number of times!" song, predating the release of Limp Bizkit's "Hot Dog" by over a year.{{% /margin-note %}} "So Good" by Destiny's Child, "That's How Strong My Love Is" by Alicia Keys, "So Long, Jimmy" by James Blunt, "There for You" by Flyleaf, "Admit It!!!" by Say Anything, "Combat" by Flobots, "Fake" by Busted, and/or "So Damn Clever" by Plain White T's.

## "Good God, you're coming up with reasons"

This leads to a question: Why?{{% margin-note side %}}Not like "why did I do this"---we know the answer to that already: Because something is profoundly wrong with me.{{% /margin-note %}}

Based on rough search result counts, I estimate the peak of this "fake" era to be right around the year 2004, extending maybe six or seven years on each side. You can find the word in all kinds of genres spanning every imaginable decade, but there is a definite hot spot at the intersection of alternative metal and the mid 2000s.

Song lyrics always have at least two layers: what is said{{% margin-note side %}}"Fake" is what is said. This article says "fake" TODO times.{{% /margin-note %}} and what is meant. We've examined some of the most common meanings already, but it's worth a recap:

- Glue word to assist with a rhyme or metaphor
- Dreamlike situations
- Insincere emotions or acts
- Literal fake appearance (e.g. plastic surgery)
- Putting down exes, enemies or rivals
- Resistance to conformity, sense of superiority
- Refusal to come to terms with something
- Fear of showing weakness
- Self loathing

There are common themes present. The metaphors, dreams, and even a lot of the insencere elements have been part of storytelling as far back as I care to look. Somebody did something wrong to me, here's how I reacted, there's the outline of this story's plot. Most "fake" lyrics from the pre-2000s tends to use one of the themes from this group.

The denial, fear, and self-loathing elements, whether real or percieved, all play well into the genre's themes of anger and anguish. These kinds of lyrics describe a person who is objectively depressed, or at least on the road that leads to the condition. In these cases, the fakeness is in the artist's head, giving the listener a glimpse into their situation and the perspective to appreciate the blessing of not being burdened with that. Or if the listener is already angsty or wants to feel it a little more, the song can serve as a blueprint for that.

The more interesting themes take a sort of "us vs. them" position. In these, the artist is quantifiably different from some other group, and either the artist hates the group and refuses to be like them, or the group hates the artist and is trying to force conformity. The plastic surgery group falsifies their appearance, the fame-seeking group sacrifices their morals, the copycat artists imitate perfoemance styles without understanding the culture, any any group the artist tries to make an emotional connection with uses that interaction for their own gain and hurts the artist in the process. This, I suspect, is the central thread of what it means to be fake in the context of the whole alternative scene. Which begs the question, what the hell is alternative anyway?



- alternative to what
    - old metal, dude looks like a lady, solos, mr. ouch logo
    - purity tests (name every sandwich Dave Mustaine ever ate)
    - simplistic group identity, like a biker gang
        - we're different so i have to beat the crap out of you
- alternative grew to mainstream size
    - sub-genres
    - more purity tests, poseurs and sellouts
    - middle school kid with a peavey could play it
- focus on real
    - reality tv / midpoint of the real world
    - judge judy intro
- also internet
    - what was scarce and monolithic is now plentiful
    - no longer beholden to the guy in the record store
    - people can pick and choose tastes
- wrap up
    - music is created in a movement, but detaching it is okay
    - unless you're suing somebody, you don't get to dictate
    - don't like it, pick a different medium, right sellout? END
