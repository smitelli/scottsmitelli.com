{{% /epigraph %}}

Close your eyes for a moment and allow yourself to be transported into the past, back to a time when {{% link wiki-walk-the-dinosaur %}}dinosaurs walked the earth{{% /link %}}. Seek out the first stranger you can find, and ask them to recite the first song lyric they can think of that contains the word **"fake."**

It's a bit of a stumper to anybody who hasn't consciously prepared for it. So maybe a hint is warranted: Something involving **faking a smile**, you know, pretending you're happy when you're not.

Given a few more moments, any true-blooded citizen of the 1980s might very well conjure this one up:

> Every **smile you fake** \
> Every claim you stake \
> I'll be watching you
> <footer>The Police, "Every Breath You Take"</footer>

A valid answer, but can they name _another_ song lyric from that era containing that word? One that's not the {{% link wiki-synchronicity-ii %}}track immediately before{{% /link %}} the one they just named? It's not so easy; there weren't all that many.{{% margin-note %}}I'll give you "911 is a Joke" by Public Enemy and "House of Pain" by Faster Pussycat. What have you got?{{% /margin-note %}} The 80s were simply too genuine, I suppose.

## I'll take Napster Downloads for $200, Alex.

Recently I found myself in the rather unenviable position of needing to sand the exposed surface of an entire deck. It was a back-breaking, hand-numbing, frustrating job that could only be complimented by one soundtrack: Angry post-grunge/nu metal/alternative rock from the early 2000s. It was the only thing that felt right at the time.

Squatting and kneeling, occasionally hitting a particularly determined mosquito with the belt sander, {{% margin-note %}}I go with 120 grit to really smear her blood meal around, but that's just me talking.{{% /margin-note %}} I started to pick up a pattern in the music. _A whole bunch of these song lyrics used the word "fake."_ The longer I listened, the more it happened.

Fake smiles and grins, like those Sting sang twenty years earlier, are as present as ever:

> This is the last **smile** \
> That I'll **fake** for the sake of being with you
> <footer>Linkin Park, "Pushing Me Away"</footer>

TODO smile list

## "Gonna make a break and take a fake"

It makes sense from a practical standpoint why the word "fake" in the abstract is useful in lyrics. It's short, punchy, and it can be used to set up a whole mess of different rhyme options:

> My sweet revenge will be yours, it's in the **making** \
> It's in the **taking**, **making**, **baking**, **taking**, **faking** \
> Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
> <footer>System of a Down, "Revenga"</footer>

TODO Party / Nelly Furtado ?

Of course, no discussion on rhyme scheme would be complete without mentioning this piece of poetic perfection:

> Everything's so blurry and everyone's so **fake** \
> And everybody's empty and everything is so **messed up**
> <footer>Puddle of Mudd, "Blurry"</footer>

Somehow I remember this seeming more profound when it was coming out of Winamp 3.
