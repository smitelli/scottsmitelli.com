Approximately half a lifetime ago, when I was in film school, we had a series of guest instructors come in and talk about their particular part of the trade. There was the writer/director who worked on _Saturday Night Live_ during the Julia Louis-Dreyfus years, the boom operator who asked---more than once---if any of us could hook him up with a chill weed dealer,{{% margin-note side %}}His reason for asking was more eyebrow-raising than the ask itself: Apparently his previous connection had recently died---of _old age._{{% /margin-note %}} and the thoroughly--body-pierced grip who proudly proclaimed that he almost never watched any of the movies he worked on.

One instructor, however, gave a piece of advice that stuck. He was (and still is, according to IMDb) a camera operator who had worked on at least two somewhat widely-known and roundly-hated feature films. His advice was this: Whenever hand-holding a film or video camera, stop and imagine that there is a tiny movie theater nestled deep inside it. A whole little room full of living, breathing people right there in your hands. If you shake the camera around too much, you'll make this tiny audience sick.

On its face, the idea is absurd. Everybody I've ever recounted this to has said it sounded crazy. But there is a kernel of practical wisdom here: Hand-held camera work can inject a scene with energy, but it's extremely easy to overdo it and end up making {{% link slashfilm-cloverfield-shaky-camera %}}_Cloverfield_{{% /link %}}. It's one thing to tell somebody not to shake the camera excessively. Going as far to suggest that the camera---or some essential thing inside it---could be annoyed or harmed in some way is the kind of thing that... well, let's just say it divides people.

Me, though, I think about that almost every time I pick up a camera or swipe my phone into video recording mode. I used to picture the little auditorium, the itty-bitty seats, the teeny-tiny little people filling them all up.{{% margin-note side %}}For whatever reason, my films always play to a sold-out imaginary crowd. That's probably something to unpack at some later date.{{% /margin-note %}} I don't even have to visualize them anymore; I know they're in there. I try very hard to give them a nice ride.

I don't really know the exact term to describe this. It's not anthropomorphism, and it's not personification. Maybe it's closer to {{% link wiki-animism %}}animism{{% /link %}}. Or maybe it just a smidge of good old-fashioned psychosis. I may not know its name, but I know the feeling very well.

It's always been there. It was there long before I ever picked up a camera.

    - in those days i was ruled by fear and superstition
        - had never installed DOS; the idea of doing windows was unimaginable
        - valid: don't turn computer off if hard drive light is on
        - inapplicable: park the hard drive heads, my drive had a voice coil
        - nonsense: don't leave it on overnight
    - i developed a sense that I could actually hurt the computer via software
        - hot loops, too much disk access
    - of course that's absurd, the computer is designed for this
        - except i did break a Dell Inspiron doing distributed.net

- i'm standing in a kitchen, listening to the homeowner talk about their big plans for the kitchen receptacles
    - i glance at the microwave clock. It indicates a few minutes until 4am. It is 4pm.
    - he's asking what i think, but i can tell he's already decided that he's going to do it. i zone out
    - i still do electrical, and i still have a healthy fear of it
    - making it work is the easy part. making it safe is something else.
        - can't cram the box full, don't use undersized wire, things heat up
        - don't nick the insulation, don't leave connections loose... causes arcing
        - can't split current flow between cables, you make an induction heater
        - these cause fires. haven't even touched on the electrocution hazards
    - so much of my DIY work is goverened by a fear of making a mistake
        - starting an electrical fire. drilling through a pipe. compromising structure, weathertightness, insulation
        - i'm not exactly wrong. all of these things can absolutely happen if careless
        - i don't do this out of a sense of pride in a job well done, it's a fear of a job done poorly
    - he's probably going to cut into his stack vent, feed a countertop outlet from a switch loop and end up bootlegging neutral from whatever he can find. I could say this, but he wouldn't listen.
    - Not my circus, not my GFCI nuisance trips.

- turns out that you can't run software without having some amount of physical effect
    - chips get hot, heat ages components. flash memory degrades. spinning disks are machines and machines break down.
