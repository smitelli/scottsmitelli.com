Just shy of half a lifetime ago, when I was in film school, we had a series of guest instructors come in and talk about their particular part of the movie-making trade. There was the writer/director who worked on _Saturday Night Live_ during the Julia Louis-Dreyfus years, the boom operator who asked---more than once---if any of us could hook him up with a chill weed dealer,{{% margin-note side %}}His reason for asking was more eyebrow-raising than the ask itself: Apparently his previous connection had recently died---of _old age._{{% /margin-note %}} and the thoroughly--body-pierced dolly grip who matter-of-factly proclaimed that he had never seen any of the films or TV episodes he worked on.

One instructor, however, gave a piece of advice that stuck deep in my head. He was (and still is, according to IMDb) a camera operator who had worked on at least two widely known and roundly hated Hollywood films. His advice was this: Whenever hand-holding a film or video camera, stop and imagine that there is a tiny movie theater nestled deep inside it. A whole little room full of living, breathing people right there in your hands, all watching what you're capturing as if it was projected on a big screen in front of them. If you shake the camera around too much, you'll make this tiny audience sick.

On its face, the idea is absurd. Everybody I've ever recounted this to has said it sounded crazy. But there is a kernel of practical wisdom here: Hand-held camera work can inject a scene with energy, but it's extremely easy to overdo it and end up making {{% link slashfilm-cloverfield-shaky-camera %}}_Cloverfield_{{% /link %}}. It's one thing to tell somebody not to shake the camera excessively. Going as far to suggest that the camera---or some essential thing inside it---could be annoyed or harmed in some way is the kind of thing that... well, let's just say it's a divisive perspective.

Me, though, I still think about that almost every time I pick up a camera or swipe my phone into video mode. I used to picture the little auditorium, the itty-bitty seats, the teeny-tiny little people filling them all up.{{% margin-note side %}}For whatever reason, my films always play to a sold-out imaginary crowd in a packed house. That's probably something to unpack at some later date.{{% /margin-note %}} I don't even have to try to visualize them anymore; I just know they're in there. I try very hard to give them a nice show.

I don't really know the exact term to describe this way of thinking about inanimate objects. It's not exactly anthropomorphism, and it's not strictly personification either. Maybe it's closer to {{% link wiki-animism %}}animism{{% /link %}}. Or maybe it just a smidge of good old-fashioned psychosis. I may not know its name, but I know the feeling very well.

It's always been there. It was there long before I ever picked up a camera.

## Wrong for the right reasons

Roughly three-quarters of a lifetime ago, when I was a kid in the 90s, I spent most of my free time stumbling awkwardly forward on my journey with computers. Initially I had older family members to guide me, but once they hit the limits of their own knowledge I was pretty much left alone to copy entire programs out of the pages of a thick Sams Publishing book and then spend an equal amount of time trying to figure out why the QBasic interpreter didn't approve of what I typed.

I'll be the first to admit that I didn't really know what I was doing or really why I was doing it. The programs never really spoke to me in any deeply personal way {{% margin-note %}}I once transcribed a page-and-a-half of code that produced a detailed breakdown of graduated tax brackets. That's what every nine year old secretly desires: doing income tax math.{{% /margin-note %}} and I rarely felt compelled to modify those programs to make them my own. Type, run, "hey that's pretty neat," repeat. Still, it held my interest and kept me out of trouble, and in a way the rote monotony prepared me for the boundless world of {{% internal-link altoids-by-the-fistful %}}cat turds{{% /internal-link %}} ahead of me.

That computer, a 386SX with 4 megabytes of memory, probably cost around $3,900 when it was new in 1989. By the time I was using it in 1995, it had passed through three owners' hands and was solidly a "sure, let the kid play with it" grade of equipment. It was still running DOS 5, despite the fact that DOS 6---and every version of Windows up through version 3.1---had been available for _a while._
