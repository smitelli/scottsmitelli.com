To the best of my recollection, I did my first bit of home electrical work when I was about eleven years old. My great uncle had just moved into a newly-constructed house a few neighborhoods away from my childhood home, and he enlisted my help to remove a wall switch and relace it with a timer to automatically control his front porch light.

- replaced a switch

    - given craftsman pliers
    - uncle watched over me and checked my work
    - i didn't know what i was doing, nor did i appreciate the gravity

- when i was the same age, writing basic programs
    - i didn't know what i was doing, nor did i appreciate the gravity
    - in those days i was ruled by fear and superstition
        - had never installed DOS; the idea of doing windows was unimaginable
        - valid: don't turn computer off if hard drive light is on
        - inapplicable: park the hard drive heads, my drive had a voice coil
        - nonsense: don't leave it on overnight
    - i developed a sense that I could actually hurt the computer via software
        - hot loops, too much disk access
    - of course that's absurd, the computer is designed for this
        - except i did break a Dell Inspiron doing distributed.net

- i'm standing in a kitchen, listening to the homeowner talk about their big plans for the kitchen receptacles
    - i glance at the microwave clock. It indicates a few minutes until 4am. It is 4pm.
    - he's asking what i think, but i can tell he's already decided that he's going to do it. i zone out
    - i still do electrical, and i still have a healthy fear of it
    - making it work is the easy part. making it safe is something else.
        - can't cram the box full, don't use undersized wire, things heat up
        - don't nick the insulation, don't leave connections loose... causes arcing
        - can't split current flow between cables, you make an induction heater
        - these cause fires. haven't even touched on the electrocution hazards
    - so much of my DIY work is goverened by a fear of making a mistake
        - starting an electrical fire. drilling through a pipe. compromising structure, weathertightness, insulation
        - i'm not exactly wrong. all of these things can absolutely happen if careless
        - i don't do this out of a sense of pride in a job well done, it's a fear of a job done poorly
    - he's probably going to cut into his stack vent, feed a countertop outlet from a switch loop and end up bootlegging neutral from whatever he can find. I could say this, but he wouldn't listen.
    - Not my circus, not my GFCI nuisance trips.

- turns out that you can't run software without having some amount of physical effect
    - chips get hot, heat ages components. flash memory degrades. spinning disks are machines and machines break down.
