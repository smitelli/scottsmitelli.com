I'm sure you're wondering why I called you all here today. Well, to be honest, I didn't actually call for _all_ of you; some of you probably shouldn't be here. You folks might want to quietly find your way to the exits right here and right now.

For those readers who are sticking around, I suspect I'm going to lose a fair number of you along the way. We're going to attempt to thread a pretty tough needle here and I won't be too terribly offended if some browser tabs get closed before we get there.

And hell, may as well say it: The opinions expressed here belong solely to me and do not reflect the views of my employer, and they probably don't reflect the views of anyone else's employer either.

This is for the people who look at the world and feel like everything and everybody has gone crazy. People who maybe have this nagging feeling deep inside that something isn't right here, but may be unsure about speaking up for fear of being ostracized at work or in social circles. Those of us who pause, look at this barrage of everything happening around us every day, and simply want to say no.

If anyone out there has felt for the very first time that this might finally be the "new trick" that makes them feel like an "old dog," or if you're a fresh graduate who spent years working through school toward an almost-certain career path that seems now to be crumbling into dust underfoot, you are the intended audience.

I'm writing this to tell you that it's not just you. But more importantly, you're not wrong. You are free to feel what you feel and think what you think. And I, for one, am tired of listening to people that tell me to suppress those parts of myself and surrender to a new way of being that I never asked for and frankly do not want.

Pull up a chair and endure yet another goddamn article about generative AI.

## Gotta blame it on something

In 1989, a musical act called Milli Vanilli had a number one hit titled "Baby Don't Forget My Number." This, along with the earlier single "Girl You Know It's True" secured them a spot on the _Club MTV Tour_. During one of the performances, a technical glitch caused their pre-recorded vocal track to skip and repeat, clearly betraying the fact that they had been lip-syncing to the voices of other singers. It didn't take long before news broke that the performers on the stage that night had never sung _any_ of their music---live or album versions.

In the fallout from this incident, their record label severed ties with them, their Grammy award was rescinded, and their albums were pulled from shelves. The performers{{% margin-note side %}}Fab Morvan and Rob Pilatus{{% /margin-note %}} never found any lasting success after the dissolution of the group. Lawsuits were filed by groups of customers who felt like they were sold fraudulent goods using deceptive practices.

Maybe it's just me, but I feel that same kind of treachery when somebody tries to pass off a piece of AI-generated work as if it were their own. There's always that moment---whether reading the text, examining the image, or listening to the spoken language---where I clock the presentation as "not quite right." Then the realization hits that I've been engaging with nothing of any particular substance, then I become a little pissed off at having my time and attention wasted by somebody who didn't care enough about what they were doing to truly do that thing.

Recently that feeling of indignation has started becoming displaced by something a bit more melancholy. AI restaurant reviews praising a dish that definitely is not offered on the menu, and the attentive service provided by a named member of the staff who doesn't exist. Video recommendations featuring an algorithmic guess at the swimming motions of a newborn sea otter or the smile of a down-on-his luck war vet reuniting with a service dog. Has anybody with a mouth ever tasted this cookie recipe? Has anybody with an actual butt contributed any of the five-star reviews listed next to this computer chair?

We've got enough content to infinite-scroll for the rest of our waking lives. Yet so much of it is pointless, unnecessary, lacking substance, or actively harmful. It is above all _joyless_---like listening to a Breaking Rust album {{% margin-note %}}There has been plenty of commentary regarding the track "Walk My Walk," but there is some real gold in the Singles and EPs category of Breaking Rust's artist page on Spotify. In particular, a relatively recent cover of "Photograph" that answers the question "What if we got Ben E. King's backing band, put a Temu clone of Chris Stapleton's voice on top of it, and did an Ed Sheeran song that went for _eight and a half minutes?_" It is not pleasant and it does not need to exist.<br><br>If that's not to your taste, there's also an eleven minute version of Passenger's "Let Her Go" up there. (Everything okay with your EOS tokens, buddy? Just concerned is all.){{% /margin-note %}} and eating a sleeve of unsalted saltines---while somehow forgetting that it wasn't always this way.

Look at LinkedIn for chrissakes. "A senior engineer was tasked with such-and-such," "The consultant billed for 60 hours," "Our backlog had grown to over a thousand tickets," "When I saw the 350,000 line pull request the junior engineer had opened," and on and on. These are not real things that have happened to living people. They are the result of somebody prompting an LLM to "make me sound smart and insightful to a room full of people with bad brains" while conveying nothing novel or actionable. I have taken to calling these kinds of posts **AIslop's Fables**.

If you'll indulge me, I'd like to try my hand at writing one of these ridiculous things:

> Two engineers---the systems architect Ass and the solution consultant Weasel---chanced to travel in company down a forest aisle. The Ass walked purposefully several paces ahead of the Weasel, who dawdled merrily along. At last they paused at a fork in the codebase.
>
> The Ass, ever considerate of the broader consequences of his actions, contemplated deeply the choice before him. The Weasel, uninterested in such unrewarding efforts, took rest at the base of a widespreading trie, finding great pleasure in the cool shade of its stable branches.
>
> So offended was the Ass at this display of poor work ethic, he deigned to question the Weasel's technical ability. "How foolish you should be," he brayed, "to remain unbothered by the fact that your house contains one appliance called a washing machine and another called a dishwasher. Until you see the absurdity of it, you have no business designing an API!"
>
> It was in that moment, and all at once, when Jupiter cast down a fierce storm that made both of their roles redundant.
> <footer>The AIslopica 001. The Ass and the Weasel</footer>

I find that when I mentally filter out all the obvious AI flourishes---the empty fluff, the excessive emoji, the formatting smells, the Ghibli-inspired scenes that really, _really_ love using every shade of brown---there's sometimes not a whole lot of genuine human connection left in there. And in that empty space, I begin to wonder: Where did all the people go? What are they all doing behind the artifice they're showing here? Why am I wasting my time and energy wading through these unbounded seas of _nothing?_

For a while I was able to navigate around it by really curtailing my use of social media. I only looked at LinkedIn for the S-tier trolling of a select group of professional shitposters. Reddit no longer occupied any appreciable amount of my time. There are now entire classes of Hacker News submissions that I refuse to read the comments on. {{% margin-note %}}Including the comments about this article, should such comments ever materialize.{{% /margin-note %}} I experimented with a small set of browser customizations to eliminate YouTube video recommendations and the site's ill-conceived "Shorts."

In place of all that, I started spending much more time in smaller private communities of people with shared interests, personalities, or life experience. We'd swap links to things we think might be truly interesting to the group. We wouldn't chase trends, we didn't let ourselves get overloaded with shiny distractions from outside the circle, and we set a tone that suited all of us best. Spending time in these small isolated groups really laid bare how _dogshit_ the social landscape on the broader internet felt in comparison.

I was all set to leave that part of my life behind me. Then it followed me to work.

## If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less

There are lots of different jobs out there, and a fair number of them are done on computers. As a matter of fact, when people ask me what I do for a living, I sometimes simply wave my hand and say "Computers" in a kind of no-you-really-don't-want-to-know-what-Kubernetes-is kind of way. I suspect most office workers hava a similar aspect of their job that they don't like to dredge up during polite conversation.

I'm a software engineer on paper, and that's the framing I'll use here because it's the one I know best. But I'm sure that those working in design, marketing, visual art, customer service, writing, all sorts of disciplines have felt it too. This ever-louder voice booming from on high to integrate LLMs and other generative AI tools into every conceivable point in your workstream. Maybe against your will. Probably against your own interests.

In the software engineering world, at least until quite recently, we all wrote computer code. Some of us wore the title "Coder" like a badge of honor to describe the profession.{{% margin-note side %}}I never much cared for it.{{% /margin-note %}} We spent basically the entire 2010s loudly promoting "Everyone should learn to code!" as the cure for all of the ails of that era. And coders entered the profession in droves. With a _teeny-tiny_ bit of help from years and years of interests rates near zero, the industry flourished.

There are a bunch of different types of computer code, and one way to visualize them is to imagine them as the different decks on a ship. At the bottom, we have the machine code---the ones and zeros computers are real good at but humans are real bad at. Above that we have an assembly language layer, still cryptic as all hell but at least comprehensible to a skilled and attentive person who subsists entirely on coffee. Above that we have systems languages like C and Rust {{% margin-note %}}And maybe Go if you wanna get into fights with certain people.{{% /margin-note %}} that are a pretty good mix of raw control over the computer and ease of getting things done.

One deck higher, we find ourselves closer to languages like Python and JavaScipt which hide a whole bunch of underlying concepts away in the name of making the code easier to write and reason about. And yet above that, a whole ecosystem of low-code tools that boast a point-and-click interface to building the whole application on top of their hosted platform. These would be things like Framer and Squarespace.

There is a tendency for the upper level languages to mechanically generate the code at the layer(s) beneath it. If you are working in assembly code, a tool called an **assembler** translates it into machine code without you needing to think about it. If you write C or Rust, a **compiler** takes care of the assembly of the program. Python and JavaScript are executed by **interpreters**, which were each written in a compiled language, and so on. Whatever layer the code exists at, it ultimately needs to be translated to machine code for a computer to make any direct use of it.

What we've got now is perhaps the uppermost deck of that ship: **prompt driven development**. No code of any sort, not even any pointing and clicking to move different pieces of the app around to suit your tastes. No, in this paradigm you type out exactly what you want in plain English, and an LLM chews on that prompt for a little while and then writes the necessary code in one of the lower-level languages for you. Don't like what comes out? Prompt it again, and the code will change to something else. How, exactly does it change? It is none of your concern. Same as how when you change a line of Python code, most people really don't know what that does at the assembler level either.

There is a key difference here: When you change that line of Python code, you _can_ know what that affects. Every step in the process of executing that code adheres to a rigid set of rules that is followed precisely, each and every time. You can know that extending a string past a certain length triggers a memory allocation, and in this one degenerate case it causes a register spill leading to a performance hitch that can be reliably replicated, tested for, and worked around. It's deeply tedious to trudge through each deck of the ship this way, but it is feasible.

How does an LLM arrive at its output? Nobody knows. It's simply not possible to trace what occurred across the hundreds of billions of parameters that underpin each model and replay even a fraction of the steps that transformed a given piece of context into a specific bit of code. We call this **nondeterminism**, where the output of a system varies based on factors beyond of what was provided as input.{{% margin-note side %}}Compare this with the quote "Insanity is repeating the same mistakes and expecting different results," which apparently originated in a Narcotics Anonymous pamphlet.{{% /margin-note %}} Turns out this property has a tendency to break existing code while trying to make unrelated changes. To solve that, the industry has turned to **coding agents** that incrementally make these changes in a loop, ideally finding a stable equilibrium where the new thing works and none of the existing things broke. This is pretty much where we are now, with some engineers experimenting with running multiple agents simultaneously to observe and correct each other's work.

But you didn't come here for a slapdash and oversimplified explanation of 80 years of programming history. You're here for boat metaphors!

Long time ago, probably before either you or I got into this game, the old RMS _Software Engineering_ struck an iceberg that tore a big gaping hole down the side of her hull. The Machine Code deck flooded first, and like literal rats escaping a literal sinking ship, the machine code programmers sought higher ground on the Assembly Language deck. Water began flooding the assembly programmers out, and aside from a few air pockets where the embedded systems programmers sought refuge, everyone hurried up to C deck.

By this point, news had spread that "up near the top" was where everybody wanted to be---although the reasons _why_ got a little lost in the hustle---so a huge number of programmers arrived at the Interpreted Language Decks. {{% margin-note %}}This was pretty much where I came in.{{% /margin-note %}} Some hung around for a good fifteen or twenty years, but the rising water waits for nobody. Higher still we climbed, skipping right past the Low-Code Mezzanine and straight up to the Prompting Promenade on the main deck. It is here that we've reached the top of our game; there's nothing above us but the twinkling stars punctuating the pitch black sky. From here, all the decks below do our bidding. With just a flick of the wrist, huge quantities of lower-level code are willed into existence without intervention. Simply marvelous.

Except... the ship is still taking on water. Sooner or later every deck---including the one the prompters are now standing on---will eventually go under. If you subscribe to the idea that technology will invariably improve and build on top of everything that has come before it, to the point of completely eclipsing it, why is "writing all that prompt text" such a magical bright red line of job security? Text was the _first thing_ language models ever produced! You really can't envision a future where people think it's quaint and old-timey to write AI prompts by hand?

And what happens to us in that metaphor? Just chillin', clinging to flotsam, slowly freezing to death in the North Atlantic.

## TODO

Let me be crystal clear: Not everybody wants to write software in paragraph form.

In fact, there are arguments to be made that the techniques that are emerging today are a totally distinct discipline from traditional software engineering. Perhaps the two could coexist if we could simply agree to stay the hell out of each other's lanes.

But let's be real, that's not how this seems to be going.

At multiple points in my life, I've had the opportunity to debate my peers over the following question: Is software engineering an art, or a science? The science argument is bolstered by the fact that a fair number of people who work in the industry seem utterly incapable of appreciating artistic works in any capacity, let alone creating any of it. On the other side, they've had the phrase "code is poetry" emblazoned on the footer of the WordPress.org site {{% margin-note %}}And to date, the only form of poetry for which MITRE has assigned multiple CVEs.{{% /margin-note %}} for nearly a quarter century. I've long believed---and still believe---that software has to be both. Look at a cable-stayed bridge, or a Rube Goldberg machine, or some of the stupid shit the contestants on _The Great British Baking Show_ have been asked to make over the past couple of seasons, and tell me that these didn't require the unique touch of an artist _and_ an engineer. Software is not so different from these things.

Engineers work in specifications and requirements. The end product needs to behave a certain way, adhere to certain external constraints, meet relevant regulatory criteria, not kill anybody, that type of thing. Artists work in the ambiguous undefined spaces that permeate all the little in-between areas of the work that aren't otherwise spelled out in black and white on the ticket.

- engineering is building to the spec; art is filling the gaps
    - there are thousands of ways to write, and your unique voice is but one
    - taste, intuition
- even mechanically renaming things trains you to name them right in the first place
- you can view AI boosters as being apathetic in their field
    - disrespectful to the user/team/future maintainers
- nobody cares about how the code looks
    - but they sure damn feel it at Panera, or operating an automotive touchscreen
- isn't this gatekeeping
    - yes, but not in the boys' club sense
    - more in the "don't do nuclear fission in your shed" sense
    - don't cause preventable injury and tie up first responders
