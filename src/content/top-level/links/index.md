For no reason other than because I can, here is list of every external link that has ever been published on this site (or at least all the ones that {{% link scottsmitelli-com-links-toml /%}} is aware of). The list is sorted based on the unique internal key name that I chose when I originally added each link. These key names are accessible in the `id="..."` attribute of the anchor elements.
