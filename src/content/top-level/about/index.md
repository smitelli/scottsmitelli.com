{{% margin-note feature %}}{{% picture stem=scott alt="Hi! I'm Scott." %}}{{% /margin-note %}}

Hi! I'm Scott, I reside in Durham, North Carolina, and I do a little bit of everything. I'm a software engineer professionally, and a sound mixer/editor in my spare time. I also have a wide range of other hobbies---from [writing]({{% relref articles %}}) to {{% link windowbox %}}photography{{% /link %}} to {{% link triggerandfreewheel %}}drawing a webcomic{{% /link %}}.

My [r&eacute;sum&eacute;]({{% relref resume %}}) is available online for your perusal, as well as a [list of credits]({{% relref credits %}}) detailing the various film and media productions I have been involved in. The [projects]({{% relref projects %}}) page has a lot of fun stuff on it as well.

I'm also a budding ham radio operator, and have held the Amateur Extra callsign **K4LLZ** since October 2023. If you happen to hear **WRZF584** on the GMRS frequencies,{{% margin-note side %}}_...how?_{{% /margin-note %}} that's me as well.

## Contact Information

* **Google Voice:** [909-SMITELI (764-8354)](tel:1-909-764-8354)
