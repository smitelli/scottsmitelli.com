{{% margin-note feature %}}{{% picture stem=scott alt="Hi! I'm Scott." %}}{{% /margin-note %}}

Hi! I'm Scott, I reside in Durham, North Carolina, and I do a little bit of everything. I'm a software engineer professionally, and a sound mixer/editor in my spare time. I also have a wide range of other hobbies---from {{% internal-link articles %}}writing{{% /internal-link %}} to {{% link windowbox %}}photography{{% /link %}} to {{% link triggerandfreewheel %}}drawing a webcomic{{% /link %}}.

My {{% internal-link resume %}}r&eacute;sum&eacute;{{% /internal-link %}} is available online for your perusal, as well as a {{% internal-link credits %}}list of credits{{% /internal-link %}} detailing the various film and media productions I have been involved in. The {{% internal-link projects /%}} page has a lot of fun stuff on it as well.

I'm also a budding ham radio operator, and have held the Amateur Extra callsign **K4LLZ** since October 2023. If you happen to hear **WRZF584** on the GMRS frequencies,{{% margin-note side %}}_...how?_{{% /margin-note %}} that's me as well.

## Contact Information
