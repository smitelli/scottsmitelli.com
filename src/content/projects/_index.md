This section of the site is a showcase of software projects I have worked on in my personal time. Every project listed on this site has source code available for perusal, and most of the projects that are web-based are actively running somewhere on the internet. There is no firm criteria for inclusion here; these projects run the gamut from incomplete to finished, and from totally abandoned to absolutely essential to my life. The one thing they all share in common is that they have something to do with programming a computer.
