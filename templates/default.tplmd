<img src="{$cfg->staticUrl}/images/scott.jpg" alt="Hi, I'm Scott." class="defaultScott">Greetings! My name is Scott, I reside in Durham, North Carolina, and I do a little bit of everything. I'm a web developer professionally, and a sound mixer/editor in my spare time. I also have a wide range of other hobbies -- from [writing]({$cfg->baseUrl}/articles) to [time-lapse]({$cfg->baseUrl}/time-lapse-photography) and [mobile](https://pics.scottsmitelli.com/)/[still photography](https://gallery.scottsmitelli.com/) to [drawing a webcomic](https://www.triggerandfreewheel.com/).

My [r&eacute;sum&eacute;]({$cfg->baseUrl}/resume) is available online for your perusal, as well as a [list of credits]({$cfg->baseUrl}/credits) detailing the various film and media productions I have been involved in. The [projects]({$cfg->baseUrl}/projects) page has a lot of fun stuff on it as well.
