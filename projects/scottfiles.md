**scottfiles** are Scott's dotfiles. I try not to go crazy with the visual customizations or aliases, mainly because I often have to jump onto strange servers or VMs where these files may not be installed and I don't want my muscles to forget how to use a vanilla Linux machine.

These dotfiles are designed to utilize [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to allow files to be installed under some environments but not others. This, paired with generous use of `*.d/` directories, allows for something approximating a dotfile plugin architecture.
