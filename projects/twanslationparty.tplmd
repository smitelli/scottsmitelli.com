After I wrote [twitstash]({$cfg->baseUrl}/projects/twitstash), one of the first ideas I had was to build a Twitter bot to convert every tweet I send into broken English (or "[Engrish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engrish)") and repost it. The bot eventually grew into an abstract framework to run tweets through any pair of intermediate languages, with a predefined number of "back-and-forth" cycles (similar to the way the site [Translation Party](http://www.translationparty.com/) works) and post that to another account. This framework was packaged into what is now called **twanslationparty**.
