In the fall of 2011, a Twitter account called [@horse_ebooks](https://twitter.com/horse_ebooks) gained notoriety for tweeting nonsense text, often tangentially related to horses and the equine arts. I participated in a series of heated discussions with coworkers over how the text was being generated -- the ratio of "hits" was far too high to be the result of a simple Markov chain, and while some of the phrases could be found in the [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) corpus, many phrases returned zero results in a Google search. **The Sort of Face** was my attempt at creating a bot that mimicked @horse_ebooks without any day-to-day human intervention at all.
