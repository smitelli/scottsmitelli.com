[Trigger and Freewheel](https://www.triggerandfreewheel.com/) is, just as the header graphic states, a webcomic. I started drawing it in the spring of 2008 while attempting to improve my Photoshop skills and to exercise a Wacom Bamboo pen tablet I had recently purchased. When the old method of manually uploading files and hand-editing HTML became too inconvenient, I looked to more full-featured CMS platforms. Not liking any of the WordPress-based plugins, and absolutely loathing the few I found written in Perl, I decided to build my own with exactly the feature set I wanted to see. This CMS is exactly that.
