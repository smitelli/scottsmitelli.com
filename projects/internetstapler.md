**Internet Stapler** is a stapler for our internet age. But it's so much more than that. It's a way of life and a state of mind. It is simple, and it is complex at the same time. It is a sight to behold, and I hope all can enjoy it.

In actuality, Internet Stapler was originally envisoned to be a sort of link curation service, where bookmarks could be "stapled" to each other in order to provide a semantically grouped reading list. The domain was purchased but no work on the project was ever started. When the first renewal notice came in, I had the choice to either let the domain expire or put something up there. This was that something.

Internet Stapler is really nothing more than an iframe with a JavaScript/CSS animated stapler moving over top of it. Many sites no longer work inside this iframe due to `X-Frame-Options` or `Content-Security-Policy` headers, although some still do. If a site renders as a blank page, this is the most likely reason.
