After noticing a troubling lack of web services that could objectively determine whether or not a given company was "real", I created **Is That Company Real?** to fill that need. It uses a proprietary and jealously guarded algorithm to measure a given company's "realness" to a degree of accuracy that is unparalleled in the industry. (Note: This industry is incredibly small.)
