**Untitled Reverse Engineering Project** is, well, an untitled reverse engineering project where I disassemble, understand, reimplement, and document an early 1990s DOS game using the original C compiler and x86 assembler from 1988. This has been a massive project, resulting in over 13,000 lines of ANSI C that currently compiles and plays accurately under DOSBox.

The goal is to eventually write a complete technical manuscript about all aspects of the game's workings, similar to Fabien Sanglard's **[Wolfenstein 3D](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbwolf3d/)** and **[Doom](https://fabiensanglard.net/gebbdoom/) Game Engine Black Book**s.

The project is ongoing as of March 2020, and no public links or specific details have been released. This is the place to watch for them, though!
