**Windowbox** is a simple photo gallery where I post pictures directly from my phone. This was a practice I started with my first flip phone in 2004, back when they called it "moblogging." Nowadays everyone seems to do this on social media, but I still prefer to hold the original copy of the things I share. You'll find I'm a little weird like that.

From a day-to-day perspective, Windowbox works by periodically checking an (unpublished) email inbox for new messages. Whenever it finds a new email and verifies it came from me, it posts the image attachments to the site and sends an update to Twitter on my behalf. On my phone, all I have to do is compose an email to Windowbox's contact, attach my picture, and send.

Windowbox is also my first attempt at reaching 100% test coverage in a complete web app. It's not something I think I would generally recommend anybody try, but it's not too difficult to live with since the project's development is relatively dormant.
