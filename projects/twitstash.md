One of the most lamented aspects of the Twitter API is the fact that [there is no way to programmatically retrieve tweets sent more than 3,200 updates ago](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/api/1.1/get/statuses/user_timeline). For heavy Twitter users, that means that tweets sent as recently as one year or so ago cannot be retrieved unless the ID number is known. Because I enjoy archiving things, and because I realized that I might someday want to access some of my earliest updates, I wrote **twitstash** to archive tweets as they were posted. I started running this script back when I only had a few hundred tweets, and due to continuous use I can now access (and search) every single tweet I've ever posted -- even though there are now tens of thousands of them.
